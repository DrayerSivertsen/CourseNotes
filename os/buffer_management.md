# Buffer Management


generate buffer by deleting the buffer.o file then calling 

```
mkk buffer
```

P() - locks the semaphore

V() - unlocks/frees the semaphore



write getblk and brelease

copy, read data, write to buffer (before disk)

when buffer is used you need to write out then reuse buffer

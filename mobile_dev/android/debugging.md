# Debugging

The current version of android studio has issues with printing messages, so this impairs our ability to debug

Thus the work around:

```
Log.d(tag: "tagToIdentify", msg: "Debug message here!")
```

add to search tag:tagToIdentify

Android studio has debugging built in you just have to run the app in debug mode

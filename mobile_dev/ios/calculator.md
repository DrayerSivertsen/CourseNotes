### Constraint Features
* aspect ratio
* vertical contraint
* horizontal contraint

constrain the first object in the first row to the top, then all others to the object to their sides

Click one object then click another to choose how to constrain them relative to eachother 
(ctrl + click)

### View controller class
We add the logic code to the view controller class

The way apple wants you to edit
adjust editor button -> assistant editor
(pulls up the class you are clicking to edit)

weak keyword = you can reference but it is ok if it is deallocated

viewDidLoad() the view has loaded

ctrl + click and drag to add action to UI element

## Swift
typecast happens after the variable

var(cast goes here)

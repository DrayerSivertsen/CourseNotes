# Describe Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet.

## Shared Responsibility Model
The responsibilities of datacenter infrastructure and software is shared between the provider and customer. 

* cloud provider: physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity
* consumer: data and information stored on the cloud, access security (only give access to those who need it)

Cloud service types:
- infrastructure as a service
- platform as a service
- software as a service


Consumer always responsible for: 
- the information and data
- devices that are allowed to connect to cloud
- accounts and identities of people within the organization

Cloud provider always responsible for: 
- physical datacenter
- physical network
- physical hosts

Service model determines who is responsible for:
- operating systems
- network controls
- applications
- identity and infratructure

## Cloud Models
* private cloud
    - natural evolution from corporate datacenter
    - can be hosted on premises
    - greater cost and fewer benefits than public cloud deployment
    - greater control

* public cloud
    - built, controlled, and maintained by a third party cloud provider
    - anyone who wants to purchase cloud services can assess and use resources
    - general public availability

* hybrid cloud
    - environment that uses both public and private cloud
    - handle surged demand by increasing private cloud space with public cloud

NEW
* multi-cloud
    - use multiple different public cloud providers

## Azure specific technologies for management
Azure Arc: set of technologies that help manage your cloud environment (public, private, hybird or multi)

Azure VMware Solution: migrate your VMware workloads to Azure with seamless integration and scalability

## Consumption Based Model
Types:
- capital expenditure
- operational expenditure

CapEx: typically a one-time, up front expenditure to purchase tabgible resources (new building, repaving road)
OpEx: spending money on services or products over time (renting a building, leasing a car), signing up for a cloud service is an example

Cloud computing you pay for what you use!

Benefits:
- no upfront costs
- no need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that might not be used
- ability to pay for more resources when needed
- ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed

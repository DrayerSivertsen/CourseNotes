# Types of Cloud Services

## Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
The most flexible category of cloud services, as it provides the maximum amount of control. The cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the hardware, network connectivity, and physical security. You are responsible for everything else: operating system installation, configuration, and maintenence; network configuration; database and storage configuration. You are essentially renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter. 

Scenarios:
- lift-and-shift migration: your standing up cloud resources similar to your on-prem datacenter, and simply moving things running on prem to the IaaS
- testing and development: you have configurations and test environments that you need to rapidly replicate

## Platform as a service (PaaS)
Middle ground between renting space and paying for complete and deployed solutoin. The cloud provider maintains the physical infrastructure, pysical security, and connections to the internet. They also maintian the operating systems, middleware, development toodl, business intelligence. You don't have to worry about licensing or patching for the OS and database

All infrastructure is maintained for you

Scenarios:
- development framework: provides a framework that developers can build upon to develop or customize cloud applications
- analytics or business intelligence: tools provided allow users to analyze and mine their data, better forecasting and returns. 

## Software as a service (SaaS)
The most complete cloud service model. You are essentially renting or using a fully developed application. Email, finanical software, messaging applications, and connectivity software are all common examples of SaaS.

While it is the least flexible, it is also the easiest to get up and running. Requires the least amount of technical knowledge to fully employ.

Scenarios:
- email and messaging
- business productivity applications
- finance and expense tracking

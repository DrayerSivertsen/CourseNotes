# How to debug a appkit failing at launch?

Debugging a failed launch of an AppKit application on macOS can be a complex process, but here are a few steps you can take to identify and diagnose the problem:

Check the Console: The Console app on macOS can provide valuable information about application launch failures. Open the Console app, and then launch your application. Look for any error messages or warnings that may provide clues about the cause of the failure.

Check the System Logs: The system logs on macOS can also contain information about application launch failures. Open the Terminal app and use the "log show" command to view the system logs. You can filter the logs to show only messages related to your application by specifying its bundle ID, e.g., "log show --predicate 'senderImagePath endswith "my.bundle.id"'".

Use Xcode Debugging: If you have Xcode installed, you can use it to debug your application launch. Open your project in Xcode and set a breakpoint in the "main" function. Launch your application with Xcode's debugger attached, and step through the code to identify where the launch is failing.

Use the Activity Monitor: The Activity Monitor app on macOS can show you information about your application's resource usage and process status. Launch your application, and then use the Activity Monitor to view its CPU and memory usage, and check whether it is running or not.

Try Running in Safe Mode: Booting your Mac in Safe Mode can disable third-party software and drivers, which can help you identify whether an application launch failure is caused by a conflict with other software. To boot in Safe Mode, restart your Mac and hold down the Shift key until the Apple logo appears.

These are just a few steps you can take to diagnose a failed launch of an AppKit application on macOS. Depending on the specific error message or symptom, additional troubleshooting steps may be required.

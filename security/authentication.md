# Authentication
"The process of verifying an identity claimed by or for a system entity"

## Factors
* something you know
  * password, pin, security
* something you possess
  * smart card, token generator
* something you are
  * fingerprints, iris scan, face recognition

Multifactor (2FA, 3FA) is the new norm
* prevents single point of failure

## Levels
* level 1 - no ID proofing, 1FA
* level 2 - ID proofing, 1FA
* level 3 - ID proofing, 2FA (password, token)
* level 4 - ID proofing, 2FA+ (password, token, iris scan)
To move from one level to another you need distinct methods of authentication

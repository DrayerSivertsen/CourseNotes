# Malware and Popular attacks

Malicious software
* designed to benefit an agent at the cost of exploiting another agent's components
    * benefited agent: attacker
    * exploited agent: target/victim
    * components can be device, software, or network

* differs from software bugs
    * malware is intentional whereas bugs are unintentional
    * some malware items use bugs to exploit

### Modes of operation
* covert
    * malware tries to hide itself and its actions as much as possible
    * e.g. spyware
* overt
    * malware doesn't attempt to conceal itself or its actions at all
    * e.g. ransomware

### Types
* persistent threats
* backdoor
* kits
* denial of service
* loggers
* logic bombs
* scareware
* spyware
* ransomware
* social engineering
* advanced persistent threats

## Persistent Threats
* malware that can reproduce and hide itself
    * child will resurface after deleting the parent
* worms, viruses, trojans, rogues, ...
* worms
    * recursively: scan, infect, replicate
    * goal: establish infection network
    * usually the first step in any network attack
* viruses
    * set of instructions to corrupt or modify a system's files
    * goal: damage the target beyond repair
    * use worms or trojans as a means of transportation
* trojans
    * impersonate a native system file to obtain access
    * goal: obtain access for locations unreachable by worms
    * used to breach high-level security zones
* rogues
    * a seemingly benefit-providing resource that blows up when necessary
    * goal: provide authentic benefits until triggered for blowup
    * used to distract security resources from some other malware

## Backdoor
* computing components have an undisclosed access point (backdoor) to affect unauthorized agents to perform emergency services
    * backdoor exploits this design feature
        * back orifice, clipper chip, himunuclus
* back orifice
    * uses a remote desktop protocol backdoor; runs on port 31337
        * 31337 is elite in leet-speak
* clipper chip

## Kits
* bootkits
    * code to modify MBR, VBR and other boot sectors
    * used to attack full disk encryptioni
    * ongoing issue; detection -> patching

MBR (master boot record): contains the boot information, which os to boot into or giving the choice of boots
VBR (virtual boot record): 
PBR: handles files that are too large for 

* rootkits
    * code to obtain 'root' privileges on a system
    * can be automated or manual
    * automated: corresponds with compromising a trusted root exe
    * manual: user-installs after obtaining root
## DoS
* denial of service
    * goal: block availability of computing component
    * measures: flooding the buffer leading to dam breaks
        * dam breaks: whena component receives requests beyond capacity
            * results in system crash
* distributed denial of service (DDoS)
    * establish a network of bots (botnet) 
        * bots: compromised systems where victims are not aware
            * two states: sleeper and active
                * sleeper: no background covert actions
                * active: actively running covert actions in the background
            
## Loggers
* AKA trackers
* logs or tracks a user's sctions
    * keystrokes
    * mouse movements
    * computing activity
        * offline
        * online
* a successful logging stash can:
    * yeild the target's admin password
    * provide sensitive information to help blackmail

## Logic Bombs
* similar to rogue persistent threats
* sets off a bomb to damage the system
    
## Scareware
* AKA prankware
* goal: cause psychological harm to a user

## Spyware
* AKA stealware
* goal: steal secrets

## Ransomware
* exploits eternalblue vulnerability
    * SMB protocol bug
* goal: block victim's access to data until a ransom is paid

## Social Engineering
* tricking a user into performing illegitimate activities
* goal: identity theft, unauthorized access control, system sabotage, financial gain, blackmail
* phishing
    * make the user click on a link that executes a XSS/XSRF script
    * obtain identity information from the user by posing as a trusted source
    * common avenues for attack vector staging
        * emails
        * social media platforms
        * phone calls
        * live interactions
* 'ghost in the wires' is a good read

## Advanced Persistent Threats
* modern malware items are no longer uni-categorical
* they are multi-categorical
    * involves a worm, a virus, some social engineering, some logic bombs
* measured by following factors
    * objectives
    * timeliness
    * resource level
        * skills and methods
    * risk tolerance
    * payloads
    * points of interaction
    * degree/scale
    * source of information
* e.g. stuxnet, blackenergy

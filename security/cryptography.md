# Cryptography Basics

Protects forward aspects of security
* confidentiality
* integrity
* authenticity (verifies provenance - came from where you say)
* authentication (verifies identity - who you claim to be)

Plain text: text that you can understand
Cypher text: text that you 'may' understand but will not have the correct meaning

Substitution cypher: changes english characters to different characters (alphabet -> alphabet)
Ex. english alphabet to latin alphabet

Multiple computations

Encryption
plain text -> cypher text 

Decryption
cypher text -> plain text

Brute force: trying every possible combination of decryption
Crypt analysis: analyize patterns to try and reverse engineer the encryption
Bribery: socially getting the person who sent the message to give up the encryption algorithm

AES: 10 rounds of computation that plain text goes for to become the cypher text result

## Symmetric algorithms
One secret key that is shared for both the encyption and decrpytion

## Asymmetric algorithms


## Hashing
one way encryption, once encrypted it cannot be undone
